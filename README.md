Then i did Data Modelling where i applied LinearRegression for this

When i talk on Its working:::

THE INPUT YOU GIVE IS 12 OR 4 
     AS PER THE INPUT 
YOU GET YOUR DESIRED OUTPUT AS 
array([[97.35009689]])OR array([[66.28899827]])
WHICH MEANS ,
WHEN YOU STUDY 12 HOURS YOU GET YOUR RESULT AS 97%
WHEN YOU STUDY 4 HOURS YOU GET YOUR RESULT AS 66%%
